# pyGraph
implementation of undirected graph in python

test.py uses an example from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE&t=5s to test the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path (graph.dijkstra), A-Star optimization can be used by supplying a distance metric when calling graph.dijkstra.
